# OpenCV Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice exercises using OpenCV with Python.

## Topics Covered
- Image loading and displaying
- Color spaces (BGR, RGB, Grayscale, HSV)
- Thresholding (binary, adaptive)
- Blurring (Gaussian, median, bilateral)
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Histograms (grayscale and color)
- Bitwise operations and masking
- Contour detection and drawing

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing histograms)

## How to Run
```bash
python filename.py
